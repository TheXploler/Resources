# The Resources Folder 📁

Welcome, this is where I store some random assets and code that I made for myself. You won't find anything fancy or professional here, this is just a place for me to have fun, experiment and store my things. 👀


## What's in this repository?

- Some 🖼️
- Some code that I "wrote" or copied from somewhere else 😅
- Some other stuff that I don't remember or don't want to tell you. Be careful, you might find some secrets or surprises there. 😏


## How to use this repository?

First of all, why?

But if you insist, just clone this repository into your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheXploler/Resources.git
```

Or you can just browse it online using the ithub website. But why would you do that? It's much more fun to play with the files yourself. 😜


## That's all!

I don't even know why you're here in the first place, but I hope you enjoyed browsing this repository. 

If you didn't, well, that's too bad. Maybe you should find something better to do with your time. 😝

Bye for now! 👋


## Why is this repository filled with mostly Astolfo?
<sub>It's not because I like Astolfo, okay? 😒 I just think that it's an interesting character with a unique design and personality, that's why I put him there. It's not like I'm attracted to them or anything. 😳 I mean, sure, he's cute and adorable, but that doesn't mean I want to date them or cuddle with them. 😏 I'm just a normal guy who likes normal girls. 😇 And besides, Astolfo is not even a real person, he's just a fictional character from an anime. 😅 So there's no reason for me to like him <sup>~~or femboys in general~~</sup>. I'm just curious about him, that's all. Nothing more, nothing less. 😐</sub>
